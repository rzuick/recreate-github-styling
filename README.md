# Working with react to recreate the github landing page

This is a work in progress. The purpose of this project is to become familiar with React and with using JSX in React. 
This project has been guided with base requirements from an Ada Developers Academy assignment. 
This project will begin with a bare framework, with no functionality in the search input and with the buttons visible. 

Stacks used in this project include:
- React
- NodeJS
- CSS
- HTML5
